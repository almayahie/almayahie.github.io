                          <p>Coffee’s origins trace back to the highlands of Ethiopia, where wild coffee
                         plants grew long before humans began cultivating them. According to legend, 
                         a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing power of coffee beans
                        in the 9th century when his goats became unusually lively after eating the 
                        cherries from a certain bush. ([aboutcoffee.org][1]) While the legend may
                        be apocryphal, botanical and historical evidence confirm that the plant
                        species Coffea arabica first emerged in what is now Ethiopia and adjacent 
                        regions of east Africa.</p>
                          <p>From Ethiopia the coffee culture moved into the Arabian Peninsula by the 
                        15th century, particularly in Yemen, where Sufi Muslims brewed it to sustain
                         concentration during night-prayers. ([Wikipedia][3]) The beans were roasted 
                         and brewed much like the methods used today. Yemen’s port city of Mocha became
                          a major hub for coffee export, and the beverage quickly became part of the
                           broader Middle Eastern culture of coffeehouses — places of social gathering, 
                           debate, and commerce.</p>

                        <p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, coffee spread into Europe through trade routes 
                            from the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][4]) Coffeehouses opened in major European cities and became centers of intellectual discourse, sometimes called “penny universities” because for the price of a cup you could sit and hear conversations on art, science and politics. Over time, cultivation of coffee moved beyond Yemen to the Dutch East Indies as well as the Americas, enabling coffee to become a globally grown commodity.</p>
                        <p>By the 18th and 19th centuries, coffee cultivation exploded in places such as Brazil, which by 1852 became the world’s largest producer of coffee beans. ([Wikipedia][3]) The shift from small‐scale cultivation in Arabia to massive plantations in Latin America transformed coffee from a regional beverage to a global commodity. Alongside this growth came complex economic, social and environmental issues connected to labor, land use, trade and colonialism.</p>

                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                    <p>Today coffee remains one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, and its cultural role has expanded far beyond its origins. ([Wikipedia][2]) From “third‐wave” artisanal cafés to global franchises, coffee connects cultures, economies and daily rituals. Understanding its deep history helps us appreciate how a simple bean evolved into a beverage that influences business, culture and human social interaction.</P>
                    <p>Coffee’s origins trace back to the highlands of Ethiopia, where the plant Coffea arabica first grew naturally. According to traditional Ethiopian stories, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats becoming unusually energetic after eating bright red coffee cherries. Though the tale is legendary, Ethiopian oral history and botanical evidence both confirm that coffee plants and early coffee consumption began in this region. (Source: National Coffee Association USA — NCAUSA)</p>
                    <p>By the 15th century, coffee had traveled across the Red Sea into Yemen. Sufi monks in Yemen brewed coffee to help them stay alert during late-night religious practices. Yemen became the first region in the world to cultivate, roast, and trade coffee on a large scale. The port city of Mocha (al-Mukhā) soon became internationally known for its rich coffee exports. Coffeehouses also began to appear across the Arabian Peninsula, becoming vibrant social centers for poetry, discussion, prayer, storytelling, and scholarship.

                    <p>Coffee is deeply woven into cultures around the world, serving as a
                         symbol of hospitality, connection, and routine. In the Middle East,
                          offering coffee to guests reflects respect and warmth. In Europe, 
                          the rise of cafés created spaces for art, philosophy, and political 
                          discussions. In Latin America, coffee cultivation became part of 
                          national identity and pride. Even today, a simple cup of coffee brings
                           people together—whether shared during family gatherings, business 
                           meetings, or quiet moments of reflection.<a class="expand" href="#">&#x26AB;&#x26AB;&#x26AB;</a></p>

                    <p>Coffee is also one of the most t traded commodities in the world,

                         and Vietnam rely heavily on coffee exports to sustain their economies.
                          The process behind every cup—planting, harvesting, drying, roasting,
                           and distributing—creates millions of jobs. This global industry shapes
                            international trade and influences both small farmers and large corporations.

                    <p>Beyond its cultural and economic importance, coffee is fascinating from a scientific
                         perspective. Its energizing effect comes from caffeine, a natural stimulant that 
                         increases alertness by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Coffee also 
                         contains antioxidants that contribute to potential health benefits when consumed 
                         in moderation. The flavor of coffee depends on many scientific factors: the type
                          of bean, growing altitude, soil, processing method, roast level, and brewing 
                          technique—all of which create a unique taste profile in every cup.
